# KeepAlive
A very small AutoHotKey script/executable that simulates a "Right Ctrl" press to keep your computer computing. 

It's small and simple and stupid, but it works and I just keep coming back to it. 

## Usage
You can run the AHK script directly or, if you can't run AutoHotKey, just double click the executable. It will run until killed.
